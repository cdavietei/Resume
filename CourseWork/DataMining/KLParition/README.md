#Kernighan-Lin Partitioning Algorithm

For this assignment I was required to implement the [Kernighan-Lin Partitioning
Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernighan%E2%80%93Lin_algorithm).

The graph for this problem was represented by an Adjacency Matrix.

###How to run

To compile use the following command
    javac PartitionedGraph.java

To run the Kernighan-Lin Algorithm on a CSV file use the following command
    java PartitionedGraph <PATH_TO_FILE> <NUMBER_OF_NODES> <DELIMITER>
