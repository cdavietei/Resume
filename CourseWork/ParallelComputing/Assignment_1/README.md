# __Assignment 1 Description__
Write a short C/C++ program that does the following:

1. Declare a global integer variable
1. Create N threads (N should be supplied as input to the program)
1. From within each thread:
 1. Print a message identifying the thread
 1. Increment a global variable
 1. Wait for all the threads to finish (Inside the main function)
 1. Print the value of the global variable


Note that you do not need to synchronize the threads or protect access to the data, we will
discuss that in the next stage
