# __Independent Study in Parallel & Concurrent Computing__

This directory contains assignments from my Independent study in Parallel Computing. While it wasn't a full course, the objective of this study was to lay the foundation for further work in Parallel Computing and focused on the following:

* POSIX threads
* Synchronization
* Interprocess Communication with MPI
* Heterogenous processing with OpenCL
